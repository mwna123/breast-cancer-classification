# breast-cancer-classification

## Workflow

1. Load data
2. Feature selection using correlation
3. Train-test split and scaling
4. Train models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)
5. Evaluate models (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)

### Dataset

The dataset is from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database and includes 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of breast masses.


## Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 96% |
| KNN | 95% |
| SVM | 97% |
